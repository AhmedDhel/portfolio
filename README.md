## GitHub Pages

- **Deploy via Actions:** This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` that publishes the repository root to the `gh-pages` branch on pushes to the `main` branch.
- **If your default branch is not `main`**, update the workflow `on.push.branches` to your branch name (for example `master`).
- **Alternative manual setup:** In the repository Settings → Pages, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (or `main`/root if you prefer manual publish).
- **No Jekyll processing:** A `.nojekyll` file is present to avoid Jekyll ignoring files and folders that start with an underscore.

If you want me to also configure the workflow to run on a different branch or add a custom domain `CNAME`, tell me which branch or the domain name.
